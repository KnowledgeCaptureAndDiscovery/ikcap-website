Given an input hypothesis, DISK is able to search for appropriate data to test it and revise it accordingly, and does this continuously as new data be-comes available.

We are using DISK with multi-omics data from a seminal cancer study. Ongoing research includes extending DISK to generate interactive explanations for scientists based on provenance records, developing a general approach to the design of meta-workflows, handling more complex hypotheses, and exploring the use of this approach in other areas of science.\nLinks:\n  Website\n  User Guide\n  Main Repository\n  NeuroDISK landing page\n  NeuroDISK page\n  Repositories\n EnigmaDISK DISK general DISK UI  ","date":1652137769,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652137769,"objectID":"570ecfe768663b27c40ace9980b3d1d5","permalink":"https://knowledgecaptureanddiscovery.github.io/project/disk/","publishdate":"2022-05-09T16:09:29-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/disk/","section":"project","summary":"Automating hypothesis-driven discovery in different scientific domains","tags":["Featured"],"title":"DISK","type":"project"},{"authors":["Deborah Khider"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1652138514,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652138514,"objectID":"e26ccd6b975727d4648a58d8a5973f71","permalink":"https://knowledgecaptureanddiscovery.github.io/project/linkedearth/","publishdate":"2022-05-09T16:21:54-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/linkedearth/","section":"project","summary":"LinkedEarth is a community of paleoscientists working to develop standards and software to enable paleoscience in the era of Big Data.

This means that a paper would include: 1) Documentation of datasets, including descriptions, unique identifiers, and availability in public repositories; 2) Documentation of software, including pre-processing of data and visualization steps, described with metadata and with unique identifiers and pointers to public code repositories; 3) Documentation of the provenance and workflow for each figure or result.\nThe Geoscience Papers of the Future Initiative has two major components:\nA Special Section of the AGU Earth and Space Science journal that will highlight GPFs. We have partnered with the largest scientific society in geosciences to create a special issue of their new cross-disciplinary journal to encourage submissions of GPFs that will help move the geosciences community to publish all digital objects resulting from their research. A training program that offers training sessions for geoscientists to learn best practices in software and data sharing, provenance documentation, and scholarly publication. These training sessions will be offered in different modalities throughout 2015 (e.g. AGU Fall Meeting, GSA, ESIP, etc.). Training materials will be freely available on line.

We present an approach that facilitates the dissemination of hydrological models, and its implementation in the Model INTegration (MINT) framework. Our approach follows principles from software engineering to create software components that reveal only selected functionality of models which is of interest to users while abstracting from implementation complexity, and to generate metadata for the model components. This methodology makes the models more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable in support of FAIR principles. We showcase our methodology and its implementation in MINT using two case studies. We illustrate how the models SWAT and MODFLOW are turned into software components by hydrology experts, and how users without hydrology expertise can find, adapt, and execute them. The two models differ in terms of represented processes and in model design and structure. Our approach also benefits expert modelers, by simplifying model sharing and the execution of model ensembles. MINT is a general modeling framework that uses artificial intelligence techniques to assist users, and is released as open-source software.","tags":["Software metadata","Model metadata","Model encapsulation","Model catalogs","MINT","Hydrological models"],"title":"A framework for the broad dissemination of hydrological models for non-expert users","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"The OntoSoft project is part of the NSF EarthCube Initiative.
