OPMW is an ontology for describing workflows based on the Open Provenance Model. It has been designed as a profile for OPM, extending and reusing OPM's core ontologies OPMV (OPM-Vocabulary) and OPMO (OPM-Ontology). Since the publication of the PROV-O standard, the ontology also extends the W3C recommendation.
