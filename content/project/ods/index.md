Over the last hundred years, science has become an increasingly collaborative endeavor. Scientific collaborations, sometimes referred to as â€œcollaboratoriesâ€ and â€œvirtual organizationsâ€, range from those that work closely together and others that are more loosely coordinated. Some scientific collaborations revolve around sharing instruments (e.g., the Large Hadron Collider), others focus on a shared database (e.g., the Sloan Sky Digital Survey), others form around a shared software base (e.g., SciPy), and others around a shared scientific question (e.g., the Human Genome Project).
