autoTS is an automated system for time series analysis that uses semnatic workflows to represent sophisticated methods and their constraints. AutoTs extends the [WINGS workflow system](https://www.wings-workflows.org) with new capbilities to cutomize general methods to specific datasets based on key characteristics of the data.

The methods are encapsulated in the [Pyleoclim package](http://linkedearth.github.io/Pyleoclim_util/)

This repository contains the following:
* Notebooks the describe a certain methodology and workflow strategies
* Sample data with know characteristics (e.g. periodicity, noise, amount of missing data) to test the methods and workflow strategies.
* Code to automatically profile data (e.g. trend)
