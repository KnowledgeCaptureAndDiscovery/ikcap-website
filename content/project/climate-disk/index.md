Climate DISK uses the DISK framework to automate climate analysis using observational paleoclimate data stored on the LinkedEarth platform (in the LiPD format).
These datasets consist of paleoclimate measurements (such as tree ring width, the isotopic composition of ice, bulk composition of marine and lake sediments) as a proxy for past environmental variables such as temperature and precipitation.
