DAta NArratives (DANA)

Data Narratives are containers of information about computationally generated data.

Check out some Data Narratives examples or browse the code on Github.

Data narratives have three major components:

A record of events, that describe a new result through a workflow and/or provenance of all the computations executed;
Persistent entries for key entities involved through DOIs for data, software versions, and workflow;
a narrative account (or several), that is an automatically generated human-consumable rendering of the record and entities and may include visualizations or summaries.
