Regina Wang started working with ISI as a high school senior in 2017. She initially became involved in research through her 
high schoolâ€™s program, and wanted to join her friend while pursuing her interest in computer science in research. 
She worked for two years, participating in two different projects. For her first summer she created software to convert 
IPython notebooks into Wings workflow, specifically converting outdated IPython notebooks used by geologists. 
In her second year she participated in developing Neuro-DISK, a program continually updating neuroscience data for the 
accessibility of the neuroscience research community, by coding a program to check wikis, analyze new data, and email 
researchers when certain data has been updated daily. She graduated University of California - Los Angeles with a major in computer science in June 2022, and is currently working as a software engineer for Databricks.
