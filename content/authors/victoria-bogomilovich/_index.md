Victoria Bogomilova started interning at ISI in 2022 during her freshman year at USC. She initially started working on the ISI website and adding the intern section using GitHub to share the stories of the previous interns. While working on the website, she started working on EnigmaDISK; within EnigmaDISK, she works on uploading data to the ontologies within DISK and harmonizing the data received from Enigma researchers. She is currently in her sophomore year majoring in Neuroscience with a Musical Studies minor on the pre-medical track and hopes to continue developing the ontologies for DISK.
