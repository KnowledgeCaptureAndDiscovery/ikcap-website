I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Information Sciences Institute under the mentorship of Yolanda Gil. I completed my PhD at University of Southern California advised by Jonathan Gratch at the Institute for Creative Technologies. My research seeks to utilize artificial intelligence methods to build personalized learning system. If this work at all interests you, feel free to drop me a note.

Prior to my PhD, I completed a MSc in Robotics at the University of Birmingham through a Fulbright Fellowship, and a Bachelors Degree in Computer Engineering at North Carolina A&T.
