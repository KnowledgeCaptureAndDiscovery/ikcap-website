As a sophomore studying computer science and engineering at USC, Hanna Endrias was interested in technological research. 
After reaching out to a couple of professors, she found her interests aligned with research at ISI and started interning 
in 2018. She specifically worked on creating better hypotheses for the Organic Data Science Framework, that would help 
scientists more efficiently narrow down their research ideas (e.g project with a higher chance of success). While her 
contribution was less focused on the artificial intelligence aspect, she learned how to work required programs and coding 
while working at ISI. After graduating she continues to work in technology as a software engineer at Microsoft.
