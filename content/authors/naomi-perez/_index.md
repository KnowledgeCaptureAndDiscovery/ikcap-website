Naomi Perez started researching at ISI after her freshman year in 2018. Her first year she focused mainly on ENIGMA 
consortium, specifically on developing and updating ontologies for ENIGMA. While she wasnâ€™t majorly involved in directly 
coding for ENIGMA, she learned how to design ontologies and work within semantic web development. 
Her next summer, she returned to ISI and mainly focused on developing T2WML (table to wiki data mapping language) 
while working with the ENIGMA team for mentoring and helping with proceeding updates. Her work with T2WML led to develop 
a program that helps individuals comb through vast amounts of public data for information specifically relevant to their 
purpose. She graduated from the University of Maryland with a degree in computer science and currently works at Smartcar as 
a software engineer.
