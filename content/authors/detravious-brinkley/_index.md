I am a Masters in Computer Science student at the University of Southern California and a graduate student researcher at the Information Sciences Institute under the mentorship of Yolanda Gil. My research with Yolanda seeks to build the TGN10+ (named after my Granny, RN Tereatha Grant Nwankw·ªç) framework. The purpose of TGN10+ is to automate the analysis of health data (demographic, physiological, behavioral, psychological) for healthcare workers. If this work at all interests you, feel free to drop me a note. 

Prior to my MS, I completed a BS in Computer Science at Claflin University
