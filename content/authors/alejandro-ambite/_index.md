I am a rising senior at Mira Costa High School and intern at the Information Sciences Institude under Yolanda Gil. My research with Yolanda aims to collect all of the data from previous yearsâ€™ DataFest events, organize the data in a way that can be used and modified in the future, highlight interesting patterns or trends among these projects, and create an output, whether that be a website or Dashboard.
