Kate Musen interned at ISI the summer after her freshman year at Swarthmore. She entered the program as an Economics major with minimal 
experience in research and low computational background. She worked with two other interns on developing a curriculum to teach data science 
and the use of data science tools  to non-programmers. The goal of this course is to aide other researchers in overcoming technical challenges
within their research process by using data science. After graduating Swarthmore in 2018 with a major in Economics and minors in Psychology and 
Mathematics, Kate continued to pursue Economics. She is now in her third year of the Economics PhD program at Columbia University, with a main 
focus in health economics and secondary focus in labor economics.
