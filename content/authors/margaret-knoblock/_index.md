Margaret Knoblock researched with ISI the summer after her freshman year of college. This was her first experience in 
research and learned about this opportunity through a tuition exchange program. At ISI she learned how to better analyze 
and digest code with the task of improving internal repositories for scientific software. She worked on improving website 
code for better user experience. Knoblock graduated in 2020 from Bucknell University in Pennsylvania with a degree in 
computer science. Margaretâ€™s work at ISI helped her recognize her interest in web development, and she continues to work 
directly in web development at ViaStat as a software engineer.
