I am a undergraduate majoring in Computational Mathematics and student researcher at the Information Sciences Institute under the mentorship of Yolanda Gil. I am a part of the SURE program in tandem with the Viterbi School of Engineering at the University of Southern California. My research with Yolanda aims to design and implement a methodological component that supports the incremental development of software for investigating meta-analytic data alignment strategies across neuroimaging studies ADNI, OASIS, PREVENT-AD, and MIRIAD, and AIBL.
