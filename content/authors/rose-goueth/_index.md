Rose Goueth began her research career at ISI with Dr. Gil. After two years at MiraCosta community college, she decided to transfer to Smith College. 
In that summer she applied to the USC Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) and matched at ISI where she worked with other interns in developing a program that helped researchers learn how to code and develop workflows in order to enhance their research. 
This was her first research position, and through that experience she found an interest in pursuing research. 
Now, she continues to use skills she learned during her time at ISI as she pursues her interest in informatics with her own research as a fourth year medical informatics and clinical epidemiology PhD at Oregon Health and Sciences University.
Her dissertation focuses on applying and informing sexual health knowledge to young people making decisions regarding contraceptives.
