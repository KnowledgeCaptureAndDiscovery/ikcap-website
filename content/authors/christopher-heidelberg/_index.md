Christopher Heidelberg began his work at ISI as a freshman at the University of Southern California. To directly apply his passion for computer science, he emailed multiple research professors at USC and connected with ISI. His first project worked specifically with Model INTegration (MINT) and consisted of developing a tool to upload workflow components from Wings. After his first summer, he continued to work with ISI throughout his undergraduate career. He then worked on Model Insertion Checker (MIC) which helped scientists transform their software to run on machines with different parameters. He also helped with Data Narratives (DANA), a program that wrote different level descriptions of workflows based on the userâ€™s preference. He will graduate from USC in 2022 with a degree in physics and computer science and hopes to continue coding in his future.
