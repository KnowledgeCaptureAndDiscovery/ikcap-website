Alyssa Deng started her work with ISI in 2015 during her junior year of high school.
As a high school junior interested in computer science, she emailed multiple professors that shared similar research interests
and connected with ISI. Her first summer consisted of learning about data science and machine learning through working on
the Wings workflow system. She continued to participate in ISI for two more summers by working on ontologies.
She worked with Protege and created course materials for teaching data science to non programmers.
Deng graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a Bachelorâ€™s in Decision Science with a passion in user experience.
Using her interest in user experience and data science, she is now creating a startup where children can connect with
artists and learn about animation and digital storytelling.
